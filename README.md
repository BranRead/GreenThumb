# Green Thumb
## Introduction
### An app to help you to remember to water your plants and rearrange them, keeping in mind their health and the health of your pets.
### Users can track when they water their plants, record their light requirements and record the animals (if any) the plant is toxic to. 
### The goal is to release this on Google Play
## Technical
### Right now it only allows users to save their own plants and create everything from scratch. I'd like to figure out a way to have plants be searchable in a database or with an API call and have at least some plants have auto generated cards.
